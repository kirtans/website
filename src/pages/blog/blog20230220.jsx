      <h2>On Education</h2>
      <h3>Tuesday, Feb 21, 2023</h3>
      <p>The concept of education implemented today in schools can be tied back to John D. Rockefeller when he created and sponsored the General Board of Education. The board wanted to use these schools to increase literacy and improve farming techniques in the South. Their goal was to train students to become better workers. In their vision, they mention “We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science.”<sup>[1]</sup> They go on to list other creative endeavors such as authors, poets, artists, musicians, along with other professions that require higher education such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. And although that vision has changed throughout the century, the main premise of school still remains similar. To create better workers.</p>

      <p>Schools teach us many things, from basic to advanced math, science, history, and literature with some other non-core offerings sprinkled into the rotation. While all these things are important, schools miss out on teaching us the fundamentals needed to understand ourselves and the ever changing world around us. An argument can be made that not receiving a working understanding of health and nutrition negatively impacts the lives of individuals and productivity of the nation as a whole. In a study conducted by Dell Technologies, the younger generations say that school is not teaching them the skills they need to survive in a digital world.<sup>[2]</sup> Even after working for multiple years in the real world, college and high school graduates still feel like they are not set up to succeed financially. All these fears of the unknown hold back many people from reaching their true potential. There are too many things that young people need to juggle that school in it’s current form does not teach them.</p>

      <p>What schools lack, the internet makes up for…in abundance. When trying to learn new skills or lifestyle improvements, there are tons of resources on the internet that can teach you these for free. While not all of them have the same level of credibility, you can find some gems if you look hard enough. There are tons of resources in terms of free websites, YouTube channels, tutorials, and games that can teach you skills needed to excel in the digital world such as coding, design, writing, and financial planning.</p>

      <p>Back in the day, before technology and cars, people used to trek for months to find a Master - someone who was at the top of their field of study - to learn from. They believed that to truly be great, you have to learn from the great. One who has already walked the path, gone through countless hardships, and come out on top. The knowledge they hold is far superior to that of anyone else in their field. In today’s world, there are so many free and paid resources created by titans of their industry to teach you the skills necessary to get to where they are. These resources are well-curated and available at a fraction of the price of higher education. It’s hard to justify the price of higher education for the returns it offers in this modern world.</p>

      <p>In order to justify the investment we expect children and young adults to make in their education, I believe we should revisit what we believe to be the fundamentals of education. In regards to the core STEM subjects, students could benefit from a revised approach to teaching that is more interactive and engaging with the use of new technologies. In this modern world, it is crucial for the younger generation to understand how technology works and the effect it has on us. It is just as crucial for schools to properly incorporate health and wellness education so that the younger generation can be more cognizant about their mental and physical health. Financial planning should also be offered to older students who are close to graduating so they can have a grasp of what it takes to set yourself up for the future.</p>

      <p>While these might not address all the concerns facing public education today, I think this is a good first step towards enabling future generations for success. Making them literate in all areas, health, financial, functional, and technological.</p>
