      <h2>On Using Social Media</h2>
      <h3>Tuesday, Feb 07, 2023</h3>
      <p>
        Humans are inherently competitive and social creatures. Competition and cooperation have both played important roles in human evolution. Competition has driven individuals and groups to strive for success and improve their abilities, leading to advancements in various areas such as technology, culture, and science. At the same time, cooperation has allowed individuals and groups to work together towards common goals, creating social bonds and facilitating the exchange of knowledge and resources. These combined forces have contributed to the survival and success of our species over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today’s world where we are less focused on survival, we still have our basic needs of being social and competitive very much ingrained in us. Social media companies have capitalized on this base desire to build and grow their own platforms. They have taken a four step approach to make their platforms more attractive and addicting. These four steps are as follows: the creation of social networks, gamification of the platform, personalization and customization of your experience, and the sharing of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most fundamental operating principle for social media platforms is to provide users with a way to connect with others and build relationships. This allows them to form a community and interact with others in the same community. Facebook started off with allowing you to connect with your friends and family. This drove engagement initially and then with the introduction of groups, pages, and events, people could find more communities they belonged to and drove engagement and retention even more. Tangentially, this also fed into the human need for higher status. The following to followers ratio created a metric that signals the “influence” of that person and their social status. The need to increase your “influence” and gain higher social status started creeping into the minds of many and led to more efforts to achieve just that.

        Another fundamental part of engagement is allowing users to interact with others. Social media platforms have incorporated game-like elements into their user experiences, such as likes, followers, and ranking systems which taps into the human desire for competition and recognition, and encourages users to engage more with the platform. Most platforms have the basic likes, comments, and sharing functionalities. This not only allows engagement with the content and the poster but also introduces the element of competition. The more followers you have, the more likely you are to have increased engagement with your content. This feeds back to the status game and causes others to also take measures to also increase their follower base and status.

        Thirdly, the platforms allow users to personalize their profiles and experiences, which creates a sense of individuality and competition for self-expression. The ability to curate your own online persona the way you wish to be portrayed is a very appealing sell. On these platforms you can portray the best versions of yourself without any of the negatives. While this sounds like a good thing, this promotes unrealistic standards and creates opportunities for users to compare themselves to others, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. On the flip side, it also opens up avenues for harassment and bullying from others leading to feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression.

        And lastly, social media platforms also facilitate the sharing of information, thoughts, and experiences, which can lead to comparisons with others and a desire for social recognition. As mentioned earlier, the rise of influencers and others playing the status game can lead to feelings of FOMO and addiction by the constant posts and notifications. When not included in the experiences shared by real-life connections, it can also create feelings of isolation and disconnection.
      </p>
      <p>
        By utilizing these human needs and desires, social media companies have been able to create highly engaging and addictive platforms that attract and retain large user bases, which in turn drives revenue through advertising and other monetization strategies. This has led to misinformation being spread and users developing mental health issues. But we can’t just blame social media companies for this. After all, technology is just a tool. We have to become cognizant of how we use these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Properly utilizing social media’s power to connect others and share information can make it one of the greatest tools in our arsenal. Utilizing your network and searching for different topics can bring exposure to areas you may not have known about. If you want to learn how to cook a certain type of dish, there are thousands of videos teaching you how to make unique styles of that same dish. If you want to do research on which places to visit when you travel to a new country, there are loads of travel blogs and content creators who have suggestions and links to some of the best places to visit based on your preferences. Any area you wish to learn more about, there is a plethora of videos, blogs, and resources that can help inform and expose you to new domains. It can help connect you to people who are at the top of their fields and take a peek into their lives and thoughts.
      </p>

        And that is what I aim to do. With my writing, videos, and other content, I aim to use social media to deliver and promote positive messages. My goal is to help create a positive change in the lives of anyone who may come across my content. With all the negativity that is out there in social media, I hope to be part of the positive movement that can make the world more connected and whole. As I stated earlier, technology is just a tool, and a tool is only as good as its user.
